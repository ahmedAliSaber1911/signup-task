<div class="markdown-hjs tw-font-mono tw-text-white tw-bg-slate-700 tw-p-5 tw-rounded-md tw-text-sm md:tw-rounded-none"><div><span></span><span><h3>Objective</h3>
    <p>Using TypeScript and Angular, your assignment is to implement a responsive signup form and get it looking as close to the design as possible.</p>
    <h3>Brief</h3>
    <p>The design team at Nano Health Suite has provided you with designs for a new signup form to start from! Your task is to build out the project from the designs inside the <code>/design</code> folder. You will find both a mobile and a desktop version of the design to work to.</p>
    <h3>Tasks</h3>
    <ul>
    <li>Implement assignment using:
    <ul>
    <li>Language: <strong>TypeScript</strong></li>
    <li>Framework: <strong>Angular</strong></li>
    </ul></li>
    <li>Your users should be able to:
    <ul>
    <li>View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size</li>
    <li>See hover states for all interactive elements on the page</li>
    <li>Receive an error message when the <code>form</code> is submitted if:
    <ul>
    <li>Any <code>input</code> field is empty. The message for this error should say <em>"[Field Name] cannot be empty"</em></li>
    <li>The email address is not formatted correctly (i.e. a correct email address should have this structure: <code>name@host.com</code>). The message for this error should say <em>"Looks like this is not an email"</em></li>
    </ul></li>
    </ul></li>
    <li>You will find all the required assets in the <code>/images</code> folder. The assets are already optimized.</li>
    <li>There is also a <code>style-guide.html</code> file, containing the information you'll need, such as color palette and fonts.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Evaluation Criteria</h3>
    <ul>
    <li><strong>TypeScript & Angular</strong> best practices and recent updates is used.</li>
    <li>We're looking for you to produce working code, with enough room to demonstrate how to structure components in a small program where a reactive form, password and confirm password mismatch cross-field custom validator is used, email must be unique so a at-runtime service .ts database file must be used. </li>
    <li>Completeness: did you complete the features?</li>
    <li>Correctness: does the functionality act in sensible, thought-out ways?</li>
    <li>Maintainability: is it written in a clean, maintainable way?</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Deliverables</h3>
    <p>Make sure to include all source code in the email as an attachment.</p>
    <h3>Code Submit</h3>
    <p>Please organize, design, test and document your code as if it were going into production - then send your source code to the next email: mohammed.akram@nanohealthsuite.com.</p>
    <p>All the best and happy coding,</p>
